# Data Directory Information

This directory is a convenient location for storing .csv and .xlsx files 
containing annotated data. Files can be imported from other directories and the 
program is in no way limited by this directory. When running python scripts in 
this package directly for testing and development, it is easiest to store any 
data which will be imported in this directory.
